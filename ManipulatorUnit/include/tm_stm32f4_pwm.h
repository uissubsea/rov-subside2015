 * Version 2.0
 *	- January 03, 2015
 *	- Changed parameters for functions
 *
 * Version 1.1
 * 	- August 15, 2014
 * 	- Split timer properties with enable/disable clocks into new library. This library will be used 
 * 	  in each project where timers are included.
 *
 * PWM pins are connected to fixed possible pins

 *
 * Notes on table above
 * 	- Not all timers are available on all STM32F4xx devices
 * 	- All timers have 16bit prescaler
 * 	- TIM6 and TIM7 don’t have PWM feature, they are only basic timers
 * 	- TIM2 and TIM5 are 32bit timers
 * 	- TIM9 and TIM12 have two PWM channels
 * 	- TIM10, TIM11, TIM13 and TIM14 have only one PWM channel
 * 	- All channels at one timer have the same PWM frequency!

 * Result enumeration

 * Parameters

 * 		You select too high frequency for timer for PWM

 * 		Prescaler value is too big for selected frequency
 * 	- TM_PWM_Result_PulseTooHigh:
 * 		Pulse for Output compare is larger than timer period
 * 	- TM_PWM_Result_TimerNotValid:
 * 		Selected timer is not valid. This happens when you select TIM6 or TIM7,
 * 		because they don't have PWM capability.
 * 	- TM_PWM_Result_ChannelNotValid:
 * 		Channel is not valid. Some timers don't have all 4 timers available for PWM
 * 	- TM_PWM_Result_PinNotValid:
 * 		Selected pin is not valid. Most channels have only 2 possible pins for PWM,
 * 		but some 3. If you select pin 3 on channel that don't have 3rd pin available
 * 		for PWM, this will be returned

 * Set PWM value for specific timer and channel with pulse high time feature.
 * You have to specify amount of micro seconds pulse will be high for specific timer and channel.
 * This method is not so good on PWM large than 100k, because you cannot set nice and correct settings, with microseconds
 * accuracy. It is perfect, and was designed for low frequencies, eg. use with servos, where you have exact amount of time
 * for servo's rotation.

 *	- TM_PWM_Channel_t Channel:
 *		Channel for which you set value
 *	- uint32_t micros:
 *		Microseconds for pulse high on PWM. Cannot be large than timer period in micros.
 *		PWM 1kHz = Timer period = 1000000 / 1000 = 1000us. This parameter can not be greater than 1000us in this case.
